<h1>ITHI M4: DNS Recursive Server Analysis</h1>

<p>
The M4 metrics measure the usage of TLDs and leakage of undelegated strings by DNS users.
As shown on the figure on the right of this text, this is not the same measure as M3,
because most users do not contact the root servers directly. Instead, they will contact
a DNS Recursive Resolver, which may be provided by their connectivity provider, by their
organization, or by a third party. These recursive resolvers will often respond to queries
with cached responses, so the root will only observe a very small fraction of the queries.
The goal of M4 is to measure the users’ behavior, which will be done by analyzing traffic
at recursive resolvers.
</p>
<p>
The usage of TLD and leakage of undelegated names is measured in M4 by 4 metrics:
</p>
<ul>
<li>M4.1: Usage volume of delegated TLDs: fraction of queries directed at delegated TLDs.</li>
<li>M4.2: Leakage of RFC 6761 Special Use Names: for each RFC 6761 name, fraction of queries 
directed at this name.</li>
<li>M4.3: Leakage of frequent non delegated strings.</li>
<li>M4.4: Leakage of other strings: all queries at strings not accounted for in M4.2 or M4.3.</li>
</ul>
<p>
The measurement of M4.1, M4.2 and M4.4 is straightforward, but M4.3 deserves some explanation.
The initial implementation would just find the top 128 strings seen at each recursive resolver
participating in the study, and list the corresponding names in the summary. Then we would merge
statistics from multiple sources, and retain the list of names that were found most frequently.
This turned out to be problematic, because the most frequent errors happen when clients look up
a local server name using the wrong domain prefix, such as looking for "myserver"
instead of "myserver.example.com". The names of local servers tell a lot about the local 
domains, and we feared that exposing them in statistics would be a privacy violation.
</p>
<p>
We mitigate that privacy issue by categorizing leaked names as either "local" or "global". We
consider that a leaked name is "global" if it belongs to the list of the names most
frequently leaked to the root, and we consider the other names as "local". In the summaries,
we tabulate all frequently leaked global names individually, but we group all local names
under a single category, "local host names".
</p>
<p>
In addition to measuring name leakage, we also measure DNSSEC deployment with 1 metric:
</p>
<ul>
<li>M4.5: % of Clients setting the DNSSEC OK bit in queries.</li>
</ul>
<p>
To compute the metric 4.5, we identify the clients by their IP address, and we weight
each client equally. We count a client as "DNS Ready" if it sets the "DNSSEC OK" option
(DO) in its queries. There is a slight uncertainty in this measurement, as the traces
will not just contain queries sent by the clients, but also queries sent by the
recursive resolver itself. However, the number of IP addresses used
by clients vastly exceeds the number of addresses used by the resolver, and we
can ignore this error.
</p>
<p>
To compute the metric 4.6, we find the zone associated with queries using the
open source <a href="https://github.com/publicsuffix/list">Public Suffix List</a> maintained
on GitHub by the <a href="https://publicsuffix.org/">Public Suffix project</a>.
We then look at the subset of queries in which the DO bit was set. If the response
included a DNSSEC records such as DNSKEY, RRSIG, NSEC, NSEC3, or DS, we conclude
that the corresponding zone is supporting DNSSEC. In constrast, if we find queries
in which the DO bit is set but never receive any DNSSEC response, we assume
that the zone is probably not supporting DNSSEC.
