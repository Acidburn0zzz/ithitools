Call with Alain & Roy.

Goal: get M3 data from the root. Get feedback on tool.

Has traffic from B, D, F and L roots.
Not all exact same format. B: limited by size, DFL, limited by time. L root is in CBOR format instead of PCAP.
BDF: response in ascii per line in a file, can be grepped, etc. Easy to work with.
Not public yet: we don't have budget for B, D and F roots. Won't get the data in FY19. Need to stick to L-root.
Format from L: 220 instances of data -- e.g. 2017/Jan/18/***.cbor, every 10 minutes.

Suggest 3 samples a day, 8 time zones so 7 hours in between, everyday on same servers -- even 200 servers. Need to add the hour. Need to run that stable for a year. Dropbox: servers are closed. Need rsync over ssh. That allows for rotating capture servers.

time frame: need to work on DNSCAP now.

Target: April 15, need to specify how to integrate with ODI. Should be ready to give them something by 4/15. That means having something ready by Puerto Rico. Need to automate at least 2 metrics by April 15 -- e.g., M3 and M7. 

Define average as "average over last 12 months", excluding the last month.

In string lists, show both the current and average. Do the union. Show null data if not documented in history.

In M3, add average of last 12 months.

For M2, do a simple table in front, and then 4 graphs.
