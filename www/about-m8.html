<h1>ITHI M8: Authoritative server traffic analysis</h1>
<p>
ITHI Metric M8 characterizes the behavior of recursive resolvers as observed by a sampling of authoritative servers.
We want to find answer to the following questions:
</p>
<nl>
<li>Do recursive servers forward gratuitous queries to non-existing domains?</li>
<li>Do recursive servers use Extended DNS (EDNS), and how?</li>
<li>Do recursive servers signal that DNSSEC is OK in their queries?</li>
<li>Do recursive servers start deploying QName minimization as part of DNS privacy efforts?</li>
</nl>
<p>
Recursive resolvers, in the normal course of operation, send queries for domain names to the
servers authoritative for these domains. We expect that authoritative servers will receive requests
from many resolvers. We also expect that there is some selection bias: pretty much every resolver
will query popular global names, but domains specific to particular countries are much more likely
to be queried by resolvers in that country. We don’t know how these potential bias affects measurements
like the use of EDNS or DNSSEC by recursive. We will only know that when we can get multiple
measurements from multiple sites and compare the results. Our first step is thus to instrument a
sufficient number of servers to at least get preliminary results.
</p>
<h2>Measuring QName Minimization</h2>
<p>
Measuring the use of EDNS or the setting of the DO bit is pretty straightforward, since the information
is visible in the queries and responses. Measuring QNAME minimization is less obvious. We first have
to understand how QName minimization work, which is shown in this comparison table:
</p>
<table>
<tr><th>Resolve “X record” for “www.example.com”</th><th>Without QName minimization</th>
<th>Standard QName minimization</th><th>QName minimization with firewall traversal</th></tr>
<tr><td>Query to the root</td><td>www.example.com/X?</td><td>.com/NS?</td><td>.com/A?</td></tr>
<tr><td>Response from the root</td><td>.com/NS</td><td>.com/NS</td><td>.com/A, .com/NS, or maybe just .com/NS</td></tr>
<tr><td>Query to TLD server</td><td>www.example.com/X?</td><td>example.com/NS?</td><td>example.com/A?</td></tr>
<tr><td>Response from TLD server</td><td>.example.com/NS</td><td>.example.com/NS</td>
<td>.example.com/A, .example.com/NS, or maybe just .example.com/NS</td></tr>
<tr><td>Query to zone server</td><td colspan=3>www.example.com/X?</td></tr>
<tr><td>Response from zone server</td><td colspan=3>www.example.com/X or maybe www.example.com/CNAME.</td></tr>		
</table>
<p>
The table shows two variants of QName minimization. The standard approach was to break down the queried name
into “zone” components, and instead of sending request for the complete name, just send successive requests
for the name server (NS) records of those components. However, early deployment attempts showed that some
firewalls were surprised to see these NS requests, and sometime blocked the packets. The “firewall traversal”
variants works by querying an A record instead of the NS record. The table shows that the length of names is
a good decision attribute:
</p>
<nl>
<li>If the name in the query is longer than the name in the response, then we can be pretty sure that the query
was not minimized.</li>
<li>If the name in the query has the same length as the name in the response, then the query may or may not have
been minimized – since in all three cases there is a final step in which the full name is queried for the server
in charge of the zone.</li>
</nl>
<p>
We also assume that in some cases, even resolvers who do not implement QName minimization will send queries for
short names such as “example.com”. To make decisions, we need to see multiple queries sent by the same resolver.
We will consider resolvers as “probably not minimizing” if the names in the queries were sometimes longer than
the name in the response, and “maybe minimizing” if the names in the queries were always the same length as the
names in the response.
</p>

<h2>Statistics per resolver</h2>
<p>
When we do statistics about characteristics like EDNS, DO or QName minimization, we could simply count the number
of queries with the tracked property, and then divide by the total number of queries. That would give us for example
the “percentage of queries with the DO bit set.” But to get statistic per resolver, we need to measure the resolvers.
</p>
<p>
We use the IP address to identify the resolvers at each data collection point, for each data collection session.
We will then for each of the attributes that we look at count the number of queries with the attribute, and the
total number of queries. We will then compute a measure for that data collection point and that session by using
a weight of 1 for each resolver. This will give us the ratios measured in a particular session. The metric itself
is obtained by averaging the ratios over all the sessions.
</p>
<p>
As part of the EDNS metric, we also want to track usage of the various EDNS options. We are already tracking global
usage of these options as part of M6, but we want here to have an indication of the distribution of these options
in the pool of receivers. The simple solution is to only sample one packet per resolver and count the appearance of
options in that packet.
</p>

<h2>Comparison with M5</h2>
<p>
The <a href="about-m5.html">M5 metric</a>
also tracks the behavior of resolvers. The data is collected by running advertisements on a large
number of clients distributed more or less randomly on the Internet, generating name resolutions as part of
processing the advertisements. The names all belong to domains controlled by the experiment, so the traffic
can be observed at servers controlled by the experiment. The name resolutions are processed by resolvers
configured for these clients, leading to sampling a large proportion of the resolvers on the Internet.
</p>
The main difference between M8 and M5 is that M8 acquires its data by looking at traffic naturally generated
by diverse clients, while M5 uses artificial traffic generated for the experiment. There may well be differences,
from the choice of names to the specific resource records or EDNS options used in the queries. In any case,
M5 does not track EDNS usage or QName minimization deployment. We believe that the instrumentation of a sample
of servers will provide complementary data on DNSSEC usage.
</p>

<h2>Limitation of the DNSSEC OK Option</h2>
<p>
We are measuring the fraction of resolvers that set the DNSSEC OK option in their queries. We understand
that resolvers may very well set that option even if they do not intend to perform response validation
according to DNSSEC. For reference, we know that in August 2018 84% of resolvers measured by M5 set the
DO bit in queries, but only 25% performed DNSSEC validation. We will carefully message that we are only
measuring the presence of the DNSSEC OK option, not actual usage of DNSSEC.
</p>

<h2>Limits of M8</h2>
<p>We considered and rejected several additional measurement ideas.</p>
<p>
We will not attempt to measure “name leakage” at authoritative servers, because this is hard to measure
without knowing a lot about the zone served by the authoritative, and there are privacy issues if we do that.</p>
<p>
We were told that we may have a problem with "pseudo CCTLD", such as ".fr.com". There may be some legitimate
use for such pseudo-CCTLD, e.g. people setting up some competition for the national service. But there may also
well be some more nefarious actions, e.g. phishers setting pseudo domains like "banque-de-paris.fr.com"
to phish customers of "banque-de-paris.fr". But it is hard to measure occurrence of such domains by parsing
samples of actual traffic. In any case, if we did want to measure this phenomenon, it should be done by parsing
recursive resolver traffic, not traffic at a sample of authoritative servers.
</p>
<p>
We will not attempt to measure the distribution of market share among recursive servers. Doing so would require
collecting lists of IP addresses of resolvers at various locations, sending these lists to our staging servers,
and computing request frequencies there. This would be a violation of our privacy rules, and we would rather not do it. 
</p>
<h2>List of M8 metrics</h2>
<p>
The design results in the following list of metrics:
</p>
<table>
<tr><th>Metric</th><th>Description</th></tr>
<tr><td>M8.1</td><td>% NX Domain Queries at Authoritative</td></tr>
<tr><td>M8.2.1</td><td>% of resolvers using EDNS</td></tr>
<tr><td>M8.2.2.X</td><td>% of resolvers using EDNS option code X</td></tr>
<tr><td>M8.3</td><td>% of resolvers that set the DNSSEC OK option in queries</td></tr>
<tr><td>M8.4</td><td>% resolvers that appear to deploy QName minimization</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
The current values of the metrics will be available <a href="graph-m8.html">here</a>,
once sampling sites become operational.
