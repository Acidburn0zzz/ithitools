<h1>ITHI Metric M5, Recursive Resolver Integrity</h1>

<h2 id="dateHeading">-</h2>

<p>The M5 metrics measure the "integrity" with which resolvers process queries. The metric is
computed by sending specially crafted queries at DNS resolvers from a large number of clients,
including queries to domains under the experimenters' control. This allows us to analyze how
recursive resolvers manage key part of the service, and how well responses sent to stub
resolvers track data updates by the authoritative servers.
There are two ways of measuring these metrics: either as a fraction of the user
population; or, as a fraction of
the total number of resolvers. We provide both
evaluations based on estimation of the population size behind each of the resolvers
that we track. We also provide an estimate of the fraction of the global population
behind the 10000 largest resolvers.
</p>
<p>
There are five components in the M5 metric:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
The metric M5.1 measures the % of visible recursive resolvers that refresh
their local cache in accordance with the time specified in the SOA TTL, and the effect on users.
For each population, we compute the fraction of users or resolvers
that re-fetch erlier than the stated TTL, and the fraction that re-fetch according to
the TTL. These two numbers do not add to 100%, because there is also a fraction of
resolvers for which our measurements are inconclusive.
</li>
<li>
The metric M5.2 measure the % of visible recursive resolvers that refresh their local 
cache automatically (without a triggering user query), as well as the estimated query
load % due to automated cache refresh and the % of users using resolvers that
auto-refresh their cache.
</li>
<li>
The Metric M5.3 measures the % of visible recursive resolvers that set the DO (DNSSEC OK) 
bit in their queries, as well as the fraction of users using resolvers that set 
the DO bit in queries.
</li>
<li>
The Metric M54 measures the % of visible recursive resolvers that perform DNSSEC validation of
responses, as well as the fraction of users using resolvers that perform DNSSEC validation of
responses.
</li>
<li>
The metric M5 provide a distribution of the estimated client size of 
the 10,000 largest visible recursive resolvers.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
In the following table, the <em>current value</em> is the
value of the metric for the current month.
The <em>average value</em> is the average value of that metric
over the 12 months preceeding this one -- or the average since the beginning
of measurements if measurements started fewer than 12 months ago.
