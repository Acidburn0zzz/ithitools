<h1>ICANN’s ITHI Project</h1>
<p>
ITHI, or Identifier Technologies Health Indicators is an ICANN initiative to “<em>measure</em>”
the “<em>health</em>” of the “<em>identifiers</em>” that “<em>ICANN helps coordinate</em>”. This is directly linked
to one of the priorities in ICANN Strategic Plan for 2016-2020: “Foster and coordinate
a <em>healthy</em>, <em>secure</em>, <em>stable, and resilient</em> identifier ecosystem.”

<p>
The goal of the ITHI project is to produce a set of indicators that will be <em>measured and tracked
over time</em> that will help determine if the set of identifiers is overall doing better or worse.
This is a long term project, expected to run for many years. The focus of the ITHI project is
strictly technical. Our role is to define metrics and perform measurements in important problem
areas, and to assess values and trends over time. We will leave interpretation and reaction to others.
</p>
<p>
We rely on various data sources and place a great emphasis on protecting the privacy of these sources.
Instead of collecting the raw data, we let these sources extract basic statistics, devoid of personal
identifiers and other sensitive information. Our processing tools are available as open source, and
the data are published through the Open Data Initiative.
