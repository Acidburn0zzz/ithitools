<h1>About the ITHI Project</h1>

<p>The ITHI project was started by <a href="http://icann.org/">ICANN</a> in 2017,
in the office of the CTO. The timeline of the project runs as follow:</p>
<ul>
<li>2017: definition of metrics, prototype tool chain.</li>
<li>Jan-Feb 2018: initial captures, M3, and M7.</li>
<ul>
<li>We also captured M2, and single source M4 and M6.</li>
</ul>
<li>March 2018: first data presented at ICANN meeting.</li>
<li>Apr-Jun 2018: pipeline automation, publish metrics on ICANN web site.</li>
<li>Continued updating and publication of metrics in the following years.</li>
</ul>

<p>The project is managed by Alain Durand at ICANN and by Christian Huitema at
