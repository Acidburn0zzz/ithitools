<h1>Participation in the ITHI study</h1>

<p>Thank you for considering participation in the ITH study. The measurements of the DNS displayed in
metrics M4 and M6 rely on statistics collected at recursive resolvers. We suppose that the traffic
observed at different sites varies. It may depend on location, time of day, day of the week, and type
of resolver, whether it is an enterprise, a University, an ISP, or a mobile network provider.
We are also interested by collecting data at authoritative servers, as this will enable us
to derive statistics on the type of load observed by these servers. The
more sites particpate in the study, the more interesting the statistics.</p>

<p>Participation in the study entails the following steps:</p>

<ol>
<li> Install the DNSCAP utility. Dnscap is maintained by <a href="https://www.dns-oarc.net/">DNS-OARC</a>. 
     One option is to clone and build <a href="https://github.com/DNS-OARC/dnscap">from
     github</a>. Another option is to <a href="https://www.dns-oarc.net/tools/dnscap">get
     the tarball from DNS-OARC</a>, and to follow the build step specified in the
     <a href="https://github.com/DNS-OARC/dnscap/blob/develop/README.md">DNSCAP
     README on GitHub</a>.</li>

<li> Download and build the ITHI tools, wich are
     <a href="https://github.com/private-octopus/ithitools/">available on github</a>.
     Follow the steps specified in the README file.</li>

<li> Run a test script to verify that the capture tools work.</li>

<li> Obtain an SSH account on the staging server, ithi.privateoctopus.com.
     This requires mailing a copy of your SSH public key to Christian Huitema
     (huitema at huitema.net).</li>

<li> Set up a "cron" job that capture statistics several times a week and upload them to the
     staging server using scp.</li>
</ol>

<p>Once this is in place, the data that you send will be used to compute the monthly metrics.
And we will also of course credit your participation on this site.</p>

<h2>Privacy considerations</h2>
<p>
We understand that the DNS traffic is privacy sensitive, and contains
Personably Indentifiable Information such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>IP addresses of users</li>
<li>Domain names of servers</li>
<li>Patterns of user queries</li>
</ul>
<p>
Our data collection methods are specifically designed to minimize the privacy issues.
We do not collect IP the source IP addresses of queries, and only process the
TLD part of queried domain names.
A capture session will produce a CSV file that only contains statistical aggregates.
The size may vary based on the amount and diversity of the
traffic, but it is typically just a few kilobytes of text, maybe 8 to 16KB. An example
of the file that we produce is available <a href="M46CollectionSample.csv">here</a>.</p>
<p>
The sources of our software are publicly available on GitHub, with an MIT license.
They can be easily inspected, and if you wish you could use it to produce a local
version of our web site, using your own data.</p>
