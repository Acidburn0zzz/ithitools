<h1>Participation in the ITHI study</h1>

<p>Thank you for considering participation in the ITH study. The measurements of the DNS displayed in
metrics M4 and M6 rely on statistics collected at recursive resolvers. We suppose that the traffic
observed at different sites varies. It may depend on location, time of day, day of the week, and type
of resolver, whether it is an enterprise, a University, an ISP, or a mobile network provider.
We are also interested by collecting data at authoritative servers, as this will enable us
to derive statistics on the type of load observed by these servers. The
more sites particpate in the study, the more interesting the statistics.</p>

<p>Participation in the study entails the following steps:</p>

<ol>
<li> Install the DNSCAP utility. Dnscap is maintained by <a href="https://www.dns-oarc.net/">DNS-OARC</a>. 
     One option is to clone and build <a href="https://github.com/DNS-OARC/dnscap">from
     github</a>. Another option is to <a href="https://www.dns-oarc.net/tools/dnscap">get
     the tarball from DNS-OARC</a>, and to follow the build step specified in the
     <a href="https://github.com/DNS-OARC/dnscap/blob/develop/README.md">DNSCAP
     README on GitHub</a>.</li>

<li> Download and build the ITHI tools, wich are
     <a href="https://github.com/private-octopus/ithitools/">available on github</a>.
     Follow the steps specified in the README file.</li>

<li> Run a test script to verify that the capture tools work.</li>

<li> Obtain an SSH account on the staging server, ithi.privateoctopus.com.
     This requires mailing a copy of your SSH public key to Christian Huitema
     (huitema at huitema.net).</li>

<li> Set up a "cron" job that capture statistics several times a week and upload them to the
     staging server using scp.</li>
</ol>

<p>Once this is in place, the data that you send will be used to compute the monthly metrics.
And we will also of course credit your participation on this site.</p>
