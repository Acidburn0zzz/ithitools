M7: OK. Echelle 0 a 100

Look at MRTG graphs -- can zoom to slices of time, etc.
2 time scales? Variable time scales? Decide: 1- beginning of time; 2- yearly.

M3.[1-2]: use pie for current value. Use stacked graphs for evolution.
    use plot.ly in Python for the graphs.
    Keep it simplefor now, not so important for San Juan/PR.

M.3.3: keep it a table. Simplify: this month, average over last 12 months.

Decision: average per month rather than daily metrics. We will see what the community says.

Registry activity: just having no activity is not important, but there are indeed differences.

Have table with results for all registries (M6). Complete table, plus top activity and top squatting. (Include registration activity metric).
As a starter, do not display list of values.

Data collection? Need call with Roy Arends to get M3 data. Should get a call with compliance and get M1 data. Need call with Dave P. to understand the registrar data. Also need to contact recursive.
