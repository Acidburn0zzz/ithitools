    <h1 id="M4PreparedFor">M4: Recursive Server Analysis</h1>
    <h2 id="dateHeading"> - </h2>

    <p>
        The M4 metrics analyze the DNS traffic at Recursive Servers.
        This is somewhat similar to the M3.3 set of metrics, with the difference that M3.3 analyze
        the traffic arriving to the root, which may be heavily filtered by the recursive resolvers.
        M4 attempts to measure the original behavior of DNS clients.
        M4 comprises 4 metrics, measuring the fraction of queries going to delegated
        TLD, to RFC 6761 special use names, to frequently leaked strings, and
        to other strings.
    </p>
    <p>
        The M4 metric also tracks the usage of DNSSEC at recursive servers through metric M4.5:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            M4.5: the fraction of DNS Clients ready for DNSSEC.
            This is computed at recursive resolvers.
            We compute the ratio of the number of clients that sent requests with the EDNS "DNSSEC OK"
            option set, over the total number of clients. Clients are identified by IP address,
            and a given IP address is only counted once. The ratios measured at recursive
            resolvers are then averaged to compute the metric.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        In the following table, the <em>current value</em> is the
        value of the metric for the current month.
        The <em>average value</em> is the average value of that metric
        over the 12 months preceeding this one -- or the average since the beginning
        of measurements if measurements started fewer than 12 months ago.

    <h3 id="M42">Queries to RFC 6761 names</h3>
    <p>
        In the following table, the <em>current value</em> is the fraction of queries
        directed at RFC 6761 names in the current month. The <em>average value</em>
        is the average of
        that fraction since the beginning of the year.

    <div id="m42Table">Table M42 not found</div>

    <h3 id="M43">Queries to frequently leaked strings</h3>
    <p>
        In the following table, the <em>current value</em> is the fraction of queries
        directed  in the current month at frequently used strings.
        The <em>average value</em> is the average of
        that fraction since the beginning of the year.
    </p>
    <p>
        Many of the strings frequently used at recursive resolvers correspond to local
        values, such as names of specific servers in the local network. We don't want to
        publish these names for privacy reasons. The corresponding queries are
        tabulated under a generic category, "(local host names)". The only strings that
        we list are those found in the top 128 strings leaked to the root, as measured
        with metric M3.
