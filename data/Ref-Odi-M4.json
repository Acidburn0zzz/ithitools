"description" : "The metric M3 tracks the traffic patterns at a set of particpating Recursive Servers.
M4 comprises 4 metrics, measuring the fraction
of queries going to delegated TLD (M4.1), to RFC 6761 special use names (M4.2), to frequently leaked strings (M4.3), and to
other strings (M4.4). The M4 metric also tracks the usage of DNSSEC at recursive servers through two metrics, M4.5 and M4.6.
M4.5 measures the fraction of DNS Clients asking for DNSSEC. We compute the ratio of
the number of clients that sent requests with the EDNS "DNSSEC OK" option set, over the total number of clients. Clients are identified by IP address, and a given IP address is only counted once. The ratios measured at recursive resolvers are then averaged to compute the metric.",
