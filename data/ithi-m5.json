"description" : "The M5 metrics measure the "integrity" with which resolvers process queries. The metric is computed by
sending specially crafted queries at DNS resolvers from a large number of clients, directed at domains under
the experimenters' control. There are two
ways of tabulating these metrics: either as a fraction of the user population; or, as a fraction of the total
number of resolvers. We provide both evaluations based on estimation of the population size behind each of
the resolvers that we track. We also provide an estimate of the fraction of the global population behind the 10000 largest resolvers. There are five components in the M5 metrics. The metrics m5.1.* measure:
% of users using resolvers that re-fetch early (M5.1.1);
% of users using resolvers that re-fetch according to TTL (M5.1.2);
% of users using indeterminate resolvers (M5.1.3);
% of resolvers that re-fetch early (M5.1.4);
% of resolvers that re-fetch according to TTL (M5.1.5);
% of resolvers where cache time is indeterminate (M5.1.6).
The metrics m5.2 measure: 
% of users using resolvers that auto-refresh their cache (M5.2.1);
% of query load due to cache refresh (M5.2.2);
% of resolvers that auto-refresh their cache (M5.2.3).
The metrics M5.3 measure:
% of users using resolvers that set the DO bit in queries (M5.3.1);
% of resolvers that set the DO bit in queries (M5.3.2).
The metrics M5.4 measure:
% of users using resolvers that perform DNSSEC validation (M5.4.1);
% of resolvers that perform DNSSEC validation (M5.4.2).
The metrics M5.5 measures the % of users using one of the top 10,000 resolvers.",
