"description" : "The metric M3 tracks the traffic patterns at a set of particpating Recursive Servers.
M4 comprises 4 metrics, measuring the fraction
of queries going to delegated TLD (M4.1), to RFC 6761 special use names (M4.2), to frequently leaked strings (M4.3), and to
other strings (M4.4). The M4 metric also tracks the usage of DNSSEC at recursive servers through two metrics, M4.5 and M4.6.
M4.5 measures the fraction of DNS Clients asking for DNSSEC. We compute the ratio of
the number of clients that sent requests with the EDNS "DNSSEC OK" option set, over the total number of clients. Clients are identified by IP address, and a given IP address is only counted once. The ratios measured at recursive resolvers are then averaged to compute the metric. M4.6 measures the fraction of Zones publishing DNSSEC records.
We compute the ratio of the number of DNS zones for which we saw at least one DNSSEC record (DNSKEY, RRSIG, NSEC, NSEC3 or DS)
over the total number of zones queried at the recursive resolver. Zones are identified by a prefix, computed using
Mozilla's Public Suffix List. Each prefix is only counted once. The ratios measured at recursive resolvers are then averaged to compute the metric.",
